## Non Public Data Sources

For our this work we requested granular profiles rather than record level data. This is outlined below.

#### Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) / Ambulance Data Set (ADS)
- Profile of relative demand by hour of a day
- Profile of relative daily demand
- Profile of relative demand by category and conveyance
- Job Cycle Time (JCT) components - mean, standard deviation, percentiles
- Relation between incident category and: ED acuity, ED length of stay (with ECDS)

#### Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS)
- Portion of ED Demand that is direct vs non-ambulance
- Relation between incident category and: ED acuity, ED length of stay (with ADS)

#### National Ambulance Coordination Centre (NACC) report
-	Double Staffed Ambulance (DSA) fleet on-duty; daily (average, maximum); relative by hour of day
-	Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) on-duty – daily; relative by hour of day
-	ED Cohorting
-	Escalation status

#### Ambulance Dashboard and Daily Ambulance Collection
-	Profile of relative daily demand (demand as: ‘F2F incidents’; ‘Incidents’; ‘Calls Answered’, ‘Contacts’)
-	Relative (F2F) demand by category and care model
-	Mean and 90th Response times daily trend
-	Handover metrics daily trend
-	Care model relative apportioning daily trend
-	F2F category by care model

#### From the previous modelling
- DSA availability vs category 2 performance
- Resources required to hit 30 mins
- Handover & A&E Performance Relation

## Public Data Sources

#### Ambulance Quality Indicators
[source](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-indicators/)
-	Mean and 90th Response times 
-	Relative (F2F) demand by category
-	Relative demand by care model
