Below is a list of insights that have supported work on defining Demand, Flows, Supply, Job Cycle Time, Escalations, ED behaviour  - both from a model construction and input definition perspective.

Further, after going through the available data several significant gaps are identified which need evidence-based assumptions:

- Behavioural - baulking, reneging, redirection to walk-ins
- Double Services Ambulance (DCA) fleet available for step-up
- Impact on allocation (conveyance, dispatch) of pressure
- Impact on JCT times of pressure
- ED queue prioritisation
- Handover delays
- Total Fleet and resource size across a lower geography footprint
- Known standard operating procedures and/or behavioural changes when under pressure
- Interventions used (e.g. cohorting) 
- Insights of patient behaviour 

Where addressed, this is either based on empirical emerging evidence (e.g. emerging trends from data), anecdotal evidence, SME feedback, written procedures under normal escalations or operation. Other aspects remain unnaddressed.

## Demand

#### Year on Year Increase



#### Within year variation of triaged calls and incidents



#### Variation over time of face to face incidents by category 



#### Variation of model of care over ambulance trusts



#### Variation of model of care by category



## Flows


#### Variation of job cycle time by ambulance trust




#### Variation of job cycle time by category




#### Variation of job cycle time by model of care



#### Handover hours lost by ambulance trust



#### Relation between handover hours lost and category 2 response times


## Supply 

####Â Resources allocated by category



#### Daily Capacity of DSVs over a year



#### Demand vs Supply
